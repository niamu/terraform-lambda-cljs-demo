# terraform-lambda-cljs-demo

A ClojureScript application deployment demo to AWS Lambda using just
the standard ClojureScript compiler and Terraform.

## Dependencies

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## Usage

- Resolve append_exports.sh name collision issues
- Docker image for zero dependency deployment
